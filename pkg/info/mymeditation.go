			Info: ` 
Three thoughts generated strongly in my deep meditation today morning.
1. Talk, chant, listen, mediate on Ram and Krishna and their devotee so much that all positive, good souls gather together around me and help me to attend God.
Always think about him and do good things so that God will also want to enjoy my company.
If I think more about krishna and Ram, I will become like him one day.

2. I am a Gopi and helping Yasodha maiya and Nand baba since Krishna is not there. Whenever they cry for krishna, I tell them not to cry otherwise krishna will be unhappy.
I am trying to make them happy and smile every moment.

3. I am a Gopi and I invited krishna at my home and I am serving food to him. I am feeding him by my hand. I also went to many others gopi home where Krishna went.

I want to share this spiritual Sadhana to everyone and hear something back from them.
I will progress in my spiritual path if share this to world.
If will progress if this talk helps little bit to someone.

if someone is in already in some spiritual path other than this specific Path of bhakti marg,
they can take only required stuff which can help in their spiritual path and ignore rest of that.

When I also hear something from differernt spiritual path, I accept only those things which help
in my spiritual path.


I heard something little bit.
I did something little bit.
I got something little bit.

One should hide Prem/bhakti.
Why ?
 Two reasons: 
   1. Sukshma Ahankar
   2. Negative feedback can disturb Sadhana

I am very cautious about these two things and I pray God to save me from these negativity.

Two Points I am going to talk.
1. About My Guru and his teaching in few lines.
2. What I did
3. What I experienced

1. About My Guru.

a group of Hindu scholars The Kashi Vidvat Parishat also conferred on him the
titles Bhaktiyog-Ras-Avtar and Jagadguruttam.

Followers claim that he is the "fifth original Jagadguru" in the series of Jagadgurus after 
Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya (A.D. 788-820), 
Śrīpāda Rāmānujācārya (1017-1137),

   II. Sravan:
   III. Kirtan, pooja 

  He says these are the process to cleanse heart.
  Then we will receive of Kripa(grace) of God.
  And we can see divya(divine) form of God, We can touch, we can talk.


2. What I did and doing 
  a. Meditation Roop dhyan
  b. Sravan - kripalu ji maharaj on youtube, read bhagwat gita, bhagwatam, Ramayan
  c. Pooja - kirtan

3. What I got:
  Prem ki anubhuti - Experience of divine love 
    - for few seconds.
    - now for few minutes
    - trying for hours and days.

feeling of great happiness in mind that can not be compared to any material happiness.
The happiness I want to ejoy every moment.
This happiness can not be explained easily but can be experienced.




 Three stages have been ordained for God realization- they are Upasana, Sadhana & Aradhana. Generally people take them as synonymous but they mean respectively as follows-
 Upasana- namely seating near. How? By withdrawing one’s consciousness from mundane objects and directing it towards God & communicate immotionally with Him. When this process of communication starts, man beging to acquire Divine power.

 Sadhana- It means moulding one-self according to divine discipling, to own, awaken & augment truthful tendencies, virtues & true efforts with full determination by means of inner inspiration, study, satsang ect. in conformity with bright future.

 Aradhana- This means an effort to serve God through one’s own power. Now the question arises as to how at all man can be capable of serving the Almighty God? He is Formless & Bodyless.  How does He at all require the service of corporeal being? If at all, He requires, it what service can an ordinary being render to Him?
 It is known that this universe is His gross visible form. God pervades every corner of this universe. An effort to make this beautiful orchard of his still more beautiful is true service to Him?
 Upasana gives strangth to man, Sadhana develops this strength and Aradhana makes it properly useful. One, who follows this process in a prayerful mood, facilitates his path to God realization.
