			Title: "My Meditation experience - Think, chant, listen about Ram, Krishna",
			Info: ` 
Three thoughts generated strongly in my deep meditation today morning.
1. Talk, chant, listen, mediate on Ram and Krishna and their devotee so much that all positive, good souls gather together around me and help me to attend God.
Always think about him and do good things so that God will also want to enjoy my company.
If I think more about krishna and Ram, I will become like him one day.

2. I am a Gopi and helping Yasodha maiya and Nand baba since Krishna is not there. Whenever they cry for krishna, I tell them not to cry otherwise krishna will be unhappy.
I am trying to make them happy and smile every moment.

3. I am a Gopi and I invited krishna at my home and I am serving food to him. I am feeding him by my hand. I also went to many others gopi home where Krishna went.

Enjoyment in sex is the way to get the world.

Bhakti(Prem) is the only way to attain Krishna. 
Real Joy is only in Prem & Bhakti of Ram & Krishna.

Searching happiness in world is foolish way.
When I sleep more than required, it gives bad energy.

Bhakti marg.
Get up when eyes open in the morning and remember Krishna & Ram and his leela.
Remember Krishna & Ram everytime.
Remember Ram Krishan before doing anything.
Bring Ram & Krishna in every work and make him happy with every action.

Power of Prem can destroy all negativity - Lust, anger, greed.
